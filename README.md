## FAQ

#### Do I have to download all the files or just the executable?

You can just download the executable. However, it is recommended that you install the entire .zip package of this repo and extract all files along with the executable
to make sure everything runs smoothly.

#### Why does it look different on OS X and non-windows computers?

I have not configured the correct styling for tkinter windows that run on OS X or non WINDOWS systems. I will be updating this periodically and will announce a final version soon.
